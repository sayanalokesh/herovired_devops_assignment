## Assignment Description

1. The Python function check_password_strength validates the strength of a password based on specific criteria. The function checks if the password is at least 8 characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, at least one digit, and at least one special character. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the password meets the criteria. Additionally, a user-friendly script allows users to input a password and the check_password_strength function is called to validate it. Based on the strength of the password, appropriate feedback is provided to the user, encouraging them to create stronger passwords that adhere to the outlined requirements.

2. The program continuously monitors the CPU usage of the local machine, triggering an alert message if it exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%). It runs indefinitely until manually interrupted, ensuring real-time monitoring. Additionally, the program is equipped with robust error handling to effectively manage and address any exceptions that may occur during the monitoring process.

3. A program is implemented to read a configuration file and extract specific key-value pairs from it. The extracted information is stored in a data structure, such as a dictionary or list. Errors are handled gracefully in case the configuration file is not found or cannot be read. The output file data is saved as JSON data in the database and a GET request is created to fetch this information. This program can be used to automate configuration management tasks in DevOps. It can help to maintain consistency and manage infrastructure efficiently.
